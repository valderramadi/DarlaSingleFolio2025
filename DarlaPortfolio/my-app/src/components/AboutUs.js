//         </h1>
//         <p> Hi, you! My name is Darla Valderrama, and I’m really glad you’re here. I’d like to think of myself as a creative data storyteller. I enjoy the power numbers and figures can have over spaces and people. I think it’s a beautiful thing what us data enthusiasts can do with our hands and analytical mindsets. I am driven and an innovative individual that strives to make impact. With the deep curiosity I hold and dedication to being a lifelong learner, I am eager to interpret data within an innovative sector. The power of data  I am dedicated to mastering it!

//             About my website
//         </h1>
//         <p>
//         Some things you’ll find in this site include projects that I have worked both independently and in my last semester of college. There is a diverse mixture of blueprints and designs that you’ll find all throughout. Some of these include: EDA’s (Exploratory Data Analysis), Data Visualization findings, and ML (Machine Learning) initiatives using deep neural networks and statistical modeling like regression analysis and more simple models like linear regression findings. 
//         You’ll also find some databases management integrated into some of the projects’ ecosystems, as well as A/B Testing and Full Tech Stack Projects like the one you’ll find on the first page entering my website. Please enjoy!
